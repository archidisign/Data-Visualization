		<h2>Data Collection</h2>
		Surprisingly, there were no easy TV ratings available for TV series. After searching on the main resources such as Google Dataset and Reddit, I settled on generating the dataset myself. <strong>TV by the Numbers</strong> is a entertainment website that releases a ratings post about late night shows every week. I hence went to each of the 50 articles published in 2018 and saved all the numbers in an EXCEL spreadsheet. Notice that 5 weeks had no articles and I had to leave those numbers as N/A.
		<h2>Data Exploration</h2>
		Next, I searched up interesting information about each host and saved the information on either the excel spreadsheet or on this project repo's README (<a href="https://github.com/archidisign/Data-Visualization/tree/master/Flourish/Late-Night-Shows">link</a>). I aggregated a lot of useful information, but were only able to illustrate a fraction of it to not overload the final visualization.
		<h2>Data Visualization Templates</h2>
		I first sketched out how I wanted the visualization to look like. Pretty quickly, I settled on using Time Series and Pie Chart. As I was going through my Twitter, I noticed the new "Bar Chart Race" feature and decided to add it as a bonus on the repo. The gif however was not added to the final visualization since I wanted to make this project static. These templates were made using Flourish. Honestly, this online software was so easy to use. I was really pleased and recommend others to give it a go too.

		<h2>Data Visualization Final Result</h2>

		Finally, I combined all the information together using Illustrator. There, I added all the textual information I wanted, played with the colors and added a new legend for the time series. I wanted to highlight the highest rated and lowest rated videos and make it more evident which curve represents which host.

		Overall, I am very pleased with the final result. Flourish+Illustrator is a really good combination for data visualization.
