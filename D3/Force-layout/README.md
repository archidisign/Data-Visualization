D3 is a JavaScript library for visualizing data with HTML, SVG, and CSS. In this repository are various code experimentation using D3.

<h3> 1. Montreal STM Force Layout Map </h3>
I decided to recreate the original STM map, but using a Force Layout representation.

The code is based on a tutorial from the original book. I had to play around a bit to change the colors, the size of the circles, and add text on top of it. I also twerked variables around to get a final presentation I would be satisfied with. You can download my code directly on my <a href="https://github.com/archidisign/Computer-Graphics/blob/master/D3/force_map.html#L78">Github </a>to try it out (and I will host it on my own website soon). If you want to run the code, make sure you download the whole repository since you will need a good version of the D3 library in the same folder as your code.
